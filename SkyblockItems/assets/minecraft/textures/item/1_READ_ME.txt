Hello there, fellow resource pack enthusiast! Any subfolder within this folder does absolutely nothing to the textures.
While some resource packs use subfolders and .json files to define custom filepaths to their textures, that's super tedious and I don't want to do that lol
All subfolders that are plural (as well as any sub-subfolders within said subfolders) exist purely so I can keep track of textures.
This is the first pack I've ever made, but I find organizational subfolders to be extremely helpful. Thank you for reading this .txt file, and I hope you enjoy the pack!

List of folders that contain the actual texture files:
armor
tool
weapon

List of folders that are only for organization:
armors
tools
weapons
